        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hello, My name is Milo and I am a 2.5 year old English Bulldog!
          I was born and raised in Atwater, CA before moving to San Francisco, CA at the age of 6 months old to live with my dad (and now my mom too!). <br> <br>
          I am also a certified <b> therapy dog</b> for Jewish Family and Children's Services. In my career as a therapy dog I have visited a couple of retirement homes and have met some really wonderful people.
